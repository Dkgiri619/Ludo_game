### Important 
1. The css I have used looks decent only on pc screen, therefore cannot be use for smaller devices.
2. Almost all the standard rules have been implemented, if you find any one of them is missing, feel free to report.
3. Feel free to add some functionalities or improve the UI, because, seriously I have mostly worked on the logic only, have to work on the UI.
